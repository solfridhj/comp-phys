Numerical Physics exam 2020 Solfrid H. Johansen

The code consists of C++ programs which compute solutions to problems and store these as csv files. The Makefile should work (my system is macOS, so could be differences for e.g. Linux...), to type make to compile, and ./main to run code. Note; you have to go into the code and uncomment parts in main.cpp to do actual computations... 

The plots are generated by Python scrips, which have to be ran after the C++ code.
The Python scripts are located in the data folder.

Note that it is somewhat complicated to obtain the plots, as this was done manually (by running the code for different values and saving in appropriately named files and then running python code for those filed). I had ambitions of making this better, but did not due to time constraints.
